Child c=new child();
But this is also not an error
 parent p=new child();

-----------------------------
RTTI
run
time
type
identification .
It states that every obj has 2 references.
Ininheritance we need to call constructor mean 
     super---> Sub
     From subclass obj we access super--->sub
In case of polymorphism :
Super---->sub
In case of method:
from subclass obj we access super--->sub
and only override of sub classs
whenever a parent is create an obj of parent new childand what ever return in runtime will
down casting example["((child )p).silent()"]

ABSTRACT ClASS:
a class declared using "abstract" keyword is abstract class.
abstrat class is used to acheive data abstraction.
An abstract class consists abstract as well as non-abstract methods.
Abstract methods does not have body.
Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
An abstract class acheives 0% to 100% of data abstraction.
we can do dynamic binding inorder to create an obj 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERFACE:
An interface is a contract based model between producer and consumer.
All methods of  interface are by defaut public,abstract.
An interface acheives 100% of data abstraction.interface cannot be instantiated.



in data abstraction both abstract class and interfaces are used.and Interface is used more

An empty interface is called as tagging/marker interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARRAYS:

array of objects(int[] arr= bew int[5])
First class objects(int arr[]={10,20,30};)

types of arrays
1D array
2D array
Jagged array:no of rows is fixed but no of column is different
for each lop is defined only to iterate the data

hirerachy of Exception
JAva.lang.throwable(throwble is basically an interface in java used to find errors and exceptions. example error (;,spelling mistake,syntax prblm) example exception any erroe occurs during execution of code is called as runtime error or excetion

it has error and exception
exception has again classified into checked and unchecked exception.
-->a checked exception occurs due to system configuration(wrong inputs,missing the files)
-->a unchecked excepton occurs dur to a programmers mistake

Exception handling:
Any runtime error occurd which makes sftwr to terminates itself .it is a technique to handle run time error or exception and give an appropriate msg to an user
try
{
}
catch(ExceptionType obj)
{
}


throw                                              throws
1. Define exception                             1.Declare Exception
2.you can change the error message              2.You cannot change the error message
3.you can only define one exception             3.you can declare multiple exceptions
4."throw" is written within the method          4."throws" is written outside the method after method parameter before method body
