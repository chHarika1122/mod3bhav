Pre-tested loop:
1)these loops checks the condition first and then display the statement, if given condition is true.
2)While loop & for loop is an example of pretested loop.

Post-tested loop:
the loop which executes the statement first and then check the condition.this type of loop executes atleast once even if the condition is false.
2)Do while loop is an example for posttested loop.


FOR Loop
Syntax:
 For(intialization ; condition; updation)
{
statement inside loop;
}
statement outside loop;



the first step is intro and the 2 is condition and if it is true then the 3 is statement afterthat 4 is updating variable and the next if will check the condition is true and it continues the cycle



example loops demo




2.)WHILE Loop
Syntax:
initialization;
while(condition)
{
statemnet inside loop;
updation;
}
statement outside the loop;


Inwhile there is a chance of infinite loop
in this if we use  "1"  or   "0" it throws an error



3.)DOWHILE loop
Syntax:
intialization;
do
{
statement inside loop;
updation;
}
while(condition);
statement outside loop;









----------------------------------------------------------------
for menu driving programs we use do while loops
the major diff is for the " FOR loop" is designed in a way we need to know the s.p and e.p
"WHILE loop" is designed in a way we can use alphanumeric is done easily

nested loop :
 loop within a loop is called inner loop or nested loop


--------------------------------------------------------------------


BRANCHING STATEMENTS
break for skip
continue for termination



it has to be in a loop or a switch-continue
only in a loop break

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SWITCH CASE:

break plays a major role.





roll,name, %
Display print the details
write class studentname and create obj of student class

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
constructor is invoked (by naming itself it comes no need to call once again)
default constructor=stuone example
parameterized constructor= stutwo example
private constructor is there.it says it can access within the class but not outside the class



in a case where variables 
shadowing is removed by using "THIS " keyword


if we write private then it is used in an manner that this wont be visible
chaining of constructors
recursive type of constructor is not used




why accessors and mutators?
it is setters and getters to generate go to source and click generate getters and setter for the fields u want
inorder 






static belongs to class not to object 
final var is const in static the value of data can be changed






why inheitance
code reusability
it "is a relationship"



Superclass first in constructors

string is a class in java and present in java.lang package
String is object in java
it has 2 methods
1.String s="Testing";--------->String literals
2.String s=new string("Testing")---------------->String Objects


Java String Pool;wheneeve we create a string it will check for the data present 

String is immutable in java

when ever we use "==" it refers address in string objects
in oreder to compare a value in an object ".equals"





In string literals if the value of an variable is same then it will be in same address it wont differ but in the string objects it is not like that it will vary because it will be having address and in order to get check the data we need to use the (".equals") operator.
String buffer and string builders makes a string to be mutable


Differences btwn String buffer and string Buider?
that mthd of stringbuffer is synchronised,String builder is not synchronised.
stringbuffer is thread safe,string buider is not thread safe.
stringbuffer is slower in performance,string buider is faster in performance.



when one thread is working the other threads will be in the wait state. 


buffer clases
append is used to rewrite and handles dta
capacity -shows capacity of the file
charAt-character at index
delete-to delete the one charcter and as well as set of characters but we need to add that



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





OBJECT CLASS
an object class is a cosmic(Actually implemented to eac and every clas of java) super class.
It is used to work on objects.
equals(),hashcode(),getclass(),wait(),notify(),notifyAll()(),toString()

whwenever we do hashcode it prints
whenever we use wait it will acquires a lock and stops working there
notifyall-it is used to notify all the threads


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



WRAPPER CLASSES
converting obj to primitive or primitive to obj
It has 2 features.
1.Auto boxing->converting primitive to obj
2.Auto unboxing->Converting obj to primitive
the use of wrapper class is [inorder to get a dynamic memory allocation java introduced collection,collection support only obj type]so inorder to make that we use this class



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

java.util.date------ date d=date.currentdate();
java.sql.date-------
we have 2 pacakages with same class there arises an problem.


import java.util.Date;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGES
create package
adding classes
one pacakge calling in another thing

POLYMORPHISM


mthd overloading: It is a concept where the name of the method is same ,but change in parameter  or argument of methods.
Rules:
1.no. of arguments passed
2.datatype of arguments
3.Sequence in which they are passed

return type doesn't matters in mthd overloading

mthd overriding:It is a concept that where name of mthd is same with same parameters and arguments in super as well as sub class
method overriding is possible with the help of inheritance.
Rules of overiding
1.name of mthd should be same
2. arg should be same.
3. seq should be same.
4. return type should be same
